Every AssayMAP Z is referenced to the top of the labware -- seated, shuck and press
positions all derive from `teachpoint.z - labware.height` (see notes sections 4b
and 5b). So `height_mm` here is not descriptive metadata, it is an input to head
motion, and it must equal the vendor file's THICKNESS exactly.

Imported from the vendor .xml.roiZip files by notes/vendor_labware_to_catalog.py.
