"""Pick/place gripper plane for the AssayMAP head, pinned to reference measurements.

A 96 Eppendorf Twin.tec PCR plate moved 5 -> 8 -> 5, nothing on the head:

    pick    Z 33.632   Zg 105.000      grip at z+zg = 138.632
    carry   Z 33.632   Zg  95.000      lifted 10 mm by the gripper axis
    place   Z 33.632   Zg 105.000
    grip    G -> 9.000 at v=6.14%, F=80%   (force-controlled close)
    XY      teachpoint + 0.190 in Y = the profile's gripper.y_offset

What matters is **z + zg**, the gripper plane. `_solve_pick_or_place` splits the
travel between the two axes at `_PLATE_HANDLING_ZG_MAX`, and that split leaves
z + zg unchanged -- so the cap moves work between axes but cannot move the
gripper. Only the sum is a real position, and it was 4.710 mm short.

That 4.710 is `HEIGHT_DIFF_96AM_TO_96LT`. The constant existed in types.py and was
used only as a fallback "tip length" in `_tip_length_for_pick_place`, a branch
that is unreachable whenever the profile supplies a teach tip length -- which is
why its meaning stayed unknown for so long. Its real home is the gripper solution:
the 96AM body sits higher than the 96LT this code was written around.
