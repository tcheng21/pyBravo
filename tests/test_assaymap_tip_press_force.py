"""Golden test: tip-press force, pinned against captured VWorks traffic.

Vendor traffic for this head contains two presses of the *same* 25.0 mm
travel that differ only in force:

    full 96-channel LT250 press   force byte 170   66.67%
    partial press, <=4 channels   force byte   5    1.96%

The cartridge press in ``Cartridge_On_Off_Pos6_VW14`` uses byte 170 as well, so
one number covers both consumables at full head.

**The full-head byte is confirmed; the low end is not.** Op A sits on the
teachpoint with no subset offset, so its channel count is known from geometry
alone and 170 is a genuine measurement. The partial's channel count is *not*
known -- the operator recalls "no more than 4". Our table reaches byte 5 only at
exactly 1 channel, giving 7/10/12 for 2/3/4. So either the subset was a single
tip and the curve is right, or VWorks floors small subsets at byte 5 and we press
up to +7 bytes harder there. See T25; do not restate the low end as confirmed.

These are asserted through the *production* path -- head-type table selection,
channel interpolation, then the two scalings that produce the wire byte. An
earlier golden test here passed while production was wrong because it supplied
the current directly instead of computing it, so nothing below hard-codes an
intermediate value.
