"""Golden test: AssayMAP press and shuck Z, reconstructed from captured traffic.

Every Z on this head is referenced to the *top of the labware*, not to the deck.
Anchoring there collapses three captured operations onto one constant:

    seated Z = labware_top + 60.50      every consumable, every fixture
    seated   = approach + 25.00         the press travel, pinned separately
    shuck Z  = seated - 30.00           LT250 tips
             = seated - 23.00           cartridges

Measured (Off_PartialTipOn_Asp_Disp for the tips, Cartridge_On_Off_Pos6_VW14 for
the cartridges; deck layout confirmed by the operator):

    labware                  teach_z  THICKNESS  approach   seated    shuck
    LT250 tip box  (pos 3)   105.300      60.53    80.270  105.270   75.270
    LT250 tip station(pos 5) 105.257      60.53    80.234  105.234   75.234
    cartridge rack (pos 6)   105.157      42.60    98.057  123.057  100.057

pyBravo already computes tips_on_position the same labware-referenced way, so the
capture reduces to the two offsets in config/tip_offsets.yaml. This test runs the
real resolver and the real formula and reconstructs the captured Z -- it does not
assert the offsets against themselves.

The profile default these replace is 15.0, which is wrong for both consumables.
